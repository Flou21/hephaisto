# hephaisto

An autonomous SRE agent that investigates Kubernetes incidents and reports what it found.

It receives Alertmanager webhooks, investigates with PromQL, LogQL and the Kubernetes API
under a step, token, cost and wall-clock budget, writes a diagnosis citing the evidence it
used, and — where you have allowed it to — executes a narrow allowlist of reversible actions,
verifies them, and reverts or escalates when they do not hold.

```sh
helm install hephaisto oci://ghcr.io/truerelevance/charts/hephaisto \
  --namespace hephaisto --create-namespace \
  --set cluster.name=<the cluster label on this cluster's metrics>
```

`cluster.name` is the one value with no default, and rendering fails without it: it is in every
signal fingerprint and in every query the model writes.

**Installed as it ships, the agent acts nowhere.** `policy.actionableNamespaces` is empty, so no
write `Role` is rendered at all; `policy.autoEnabledActionTypes` is empty; and `mode` is
`Observe`. Enabling anything takes four deliberate changes, in git — naming a namespace,
labelling that namespace `hephaisto.dev/destructive-actions-allowed: "true"`, promoting one
action type, and raising the mode.

## What it needs

| | |
|---|---|
| Kubernetes | any recent version; the chart targets prometheus-operator CRDs |
| **PostgreSQL 17 with `pgvector`** | required — the agent fails fast without it, on purpose |
| Prometheus + Alertmanager + prometheus-operator | required — the shipped `PrometheusRule`s are its input |
| A model API key | Gemini, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint including a local Ollama |
| Grafana + `grafana-mcp` | optional; without it the agent degrades to Kubernetes-only reads |

`postgres.embedded.enabled=true` brings up a single-replica StatefulSet for evaluation. It is
explicitly **not** a production database.

## This chart creates no Secrets, ever

A value passed to a chart ends up in `helm get values`, in the release Secret, and in whatever
git repo holds your Argo Application — forever, and readable by anyone with `get` on Secrets in
that namespace. So every secret is *referenced* by name and each reference is wrapped in
`required`, which makes a missing one fail at template time rather than twenty minutes later as
`CreateContainerConfigError` on a pod nobody is watching yet.

```sh
kubectl create namespace hephaisto

kubectl -n hephaisto create secret generic hephaisto-postgres \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_USER=hephaisto \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_PASSWORD='...' \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_DB=hephaisto \
  --from-literal=POSTGRES_APP_PASSWORD='...'

# Both keys are optional; which you need depends on Llm:Provider.
kubectl -n hephaisto create secret generic hephaisto-llm \
  --from-literal=GEMINI_API_KEY='...'

helm install hephaisto oci://ghcr.io/truerelevance/charts/hephaisto \
  -n hephaisto \
  --set cluster.name=<your-cluster-label> \
  --set prometheusOperator.selectorLabels.release=<your-kube-prometheus-stack-release>
```

Two more are worth setting on day one. `secrets.webhookToken` names a Secret whose key `token`
the Alertmanager webhook then requires as a bearer token - Alertmanager sends it with
`http_config.authorization.credentials_file` on the receiver. And `llm.pricing`, if your model is
not in the built-in price table: with a cost cap set (they all are, by default) the agent refuses
to start on a model it cannot price, because an unpriced model bills as $0 and no cap would bind.

That last `--set` matters more than it looks: if your Prometheus does not select the shipped
`PrometheusRule`s, the agent detects nothing and reports itself perfectly healthy. `NOTES.txt`
prints the two commands that verify it, and they are worth running.

## Configuring it

`values.yaml` is densely commented and `values.schema.json` rejects invalid combinations at
template time rather than at runtime — including several that would look like a working install.

The agent binds far more configuration than the chart promotes to values: `Llm:Model`,
`Llm:Investigation:MaxSteps`, `Llm:Budget:MaxCostUsdPerHour` and the rest are settable as
`Section__Key` environment variables through `extraEnv`. That is deliberate — mirroring every
options class in YAML would duplicate them and drift the first time one is renamed.

## Routing alerts to it (v0.10.0)

Two routes, in this order, in the Alertmanager that sends to Hephaisto:

```yaml
route:
  routes:
    # The agent's own absence (alerts.agentPresence). An agent that is down cannot report
    # being down, so these go to something that is not the agent.
    - receiver: not-hephaisto
      matchers: [ hephaisto_route = "external" ]
      continue: false
  receiver: hephaisto
receivers:
  - name: hephaisto
    webhook_configs:
      - url: http://hephaisto.hephaisto:8080/webhooks/alertmanager
        send_resolved: true            # a resolve is what closes an incident
        http_config:
          authorization:
            credentials_file: /etc/alertmanager/secrets/hephaisto-webhook-token/token
  - name: not-hephaisto
    webhook_configs:
      - url: https://your-other-channel.example/hook
```

`send_resolved: true` is not optional any more: without it an incident closes only when a person
closes it. The token is `secrets.webhookToken`. The webhook answers 503 when it cannot write, and
Alertmanager retries - so a restart or a database outage costs minutes, not a lost alert.

## Code fixes (v0.9.0)

When an investigation's grounded primary finding is a bug in application code, nothing in the
cluster can fix it. With `codeFix.enabled`, Hephaisto hands that finding to a **coder** — Claude
Code in a Kubernetes Job of its own — which clones the repository the workload is mapped to and
writes a fix **plan**, read-only and automatically. After a human approves the plan, a second Job
implements it on a `hephaisto/codefix-*` branch, runs the build and tests, and opens a pull
request - a **draft**, unless the context repository's `repos.yaml` says
`defaults.pr.draft: unless-ready`. A human reviews, merges and deploys; nothing here does.

It ships **off, and unrendered**: `codeFix.enabled: false` renders no coder object at all, and
`codeFix.mode` (`off | plan | pr`) is its own axis, independent of the agent's `mode`. An
`Observe` agent can still plan code fixes — planning writes nothing anywhere — and the agent's kill
switch still stops the stage.

**What the coder can reach.** No cluster identity: its ServiceAccount is bound to nothing and its
token is never mounted. No Hephaisto credential and no inbound surface: it answers by printing a
framed result to its own log, which Hephaisto reads. The model runs in a container that is
handed its own credential and no GitHub or NuGet token: those go to an init container that has
ended before the model starts (`prepare`) and, for the push and the Draft PR, to one that starts
after it has ended (`publish`). Egress only through a squid allowlist proxy
(`codeFix.egressProxy`), enforced by a NetworkPolicy that is independent of the top-level one —
DNS and the proxy, nothing else — and every request it makes is a line in the proxy's log.

**What Hephaisto gains.** `create jobs`, in exactly one namespace. The chart refuses to render if
that namespace is `default`, `kube-*`, the release or observability namespace, or any
`policy.actionableNamespaces` entry, and the agent refuses to boot if it holds `create jobs`
anywhere else.

```sh
kubectl create namespace hephaisto-coder
# Every key optional. GITHUB_TOKEN: a FINE-GRAINED PAT, contents:write + pull_requests:write,
# limited to the mapped repositories. Hephaisto never reads this Secret.
kubectl -n hephaisto-coder create secret generic hephaisto-codefix \
  --from-literal=CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN=sk-ant-oat01-... \
  --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...

helm upgrade hephaisto oci://ghcr.io/truerelevance/charts/hephaisto -n hephaisto --reuse-values \
  --set codeFix.enabled=true --set codeFix.mode=plan \
  --set codeFix.contextRepository.url=https://github.com/you/dev-context \
  --set 'codeFix.repositories[0].workload=shop/Deployment/shop-api' \
  --set 'codeFix.repositories[0].url=https://github.com/you/shop'
```

Protect the default branch of every mapped repository before the first attempt — no direct push,
no force push, for everyone including the coder's token. It is the one control the chart cannot
check, and `NOTES.txt` lists the repositories it applies to. Start in `plan`, read the plans, and
move to `pr` only with `auth.enabled: true`: approving a repository write on an unauthenticated
click is refused at render time and again at startup.

## Investigating in a Job (v0.12.0)

With `investigation.job.enabled`, an investigation's **model loop** can run as Claude Code in a Job
beside the coder - on the same Secret's `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`, with a model of your choice -
while Hephaisto keeps the tools, records every step and grounds the conclusion exactly as it does
in-process. The Job reaches evidence only through the agent's **investigator port**
(`investigation.job.port`, 8084, `/investigate`), admitted only from investigator pods, each run
with a token of its own. It has no cluster identity and no Grafana token.

It ships **off, and unrendered**, and enabling it switches nothing over: the executor
(`investigation.job.executor`, plus the switch ConfigMap's `investigationExecutor`, most
restrictive winning) defaults to `inprocess`. It needs `codeFix.enabled` - the Job borrows the
coder's namespace, image, Secret and proxy - but no code-fix mode. A run that cannot have one of
`concurrentJobs` slots, or would exceed `jobsPerHour`, runs in-process at once; a Job that fails,
vanishes or hits a subscription limit is replaced by the in-process investigation.

```sh
helm upgrade hephaisto oci://ghcr.io/truerelevance/charts/hephaisto -n hephaisto --reuse-values \
  --set investigation.job.enabled=true --set investigation.job.executor=job \
  --set investigation.job.model=opus
# and back, without a rollout:
kubectl -n hephaisto patch cm hephaisto-switches --type merge -p '{"data":{"investigationExecutor":"inprocess"}}'
```

`investigation.job.source.enabled` also gives the investigator a read-only clone of a mapped
workload's repository at its running commit, so a finding can name file and line - shown on the
finding and passed to a code fix, never counted as evidence.

## GitHub issues as work (v0.14.0)

With `github.enabled`, an issue **assigned to Hephaisto's account**, in a repository listed in
`github.issues.repositories`, is taken as work. The agent asks GitHub - one poll per repository
every `github.pollInterval`, answered with a free 304 while nothing changed - so nothing has to
reach in and there is no webhook to expose. A taken issue is planned by a coder Job under
`codeFix.mode` and every `codeFix` cap; the plan is posted on the issue; an approver answers it
there; and the pull request the implementing Job opens - a draft, whose description says
`Closes owner/repo#n` - is followed until it is merged (the work item is done) or closed.
`GET /api/workitems` shows them, and `github` is among the connections of `GET /api/status` and
the MCP tool `get_status`. Unassigning the account, or closing the issue, takes it back at any
point and stops a running Job.

It ships **off, and unrendered**. The account is an ordinary GitHub account (a machine user) and
not a GitHub App, because an App cannot be an assignee; make it a collaborator on every listed
repository. Its token is the **agent's own**, in a Secret of the release namespace - never
`secrets.codeFix`, which lives in the coder namespace, may push, and stays unreadable to the
agent. The chart refuses the same name for both.

```sh
# Signed in as the bot account. Organisation repositories: a fine-grained token limited to the
# listed repositories - Issues read and write, Pull requests read. A repository a USER owns is
# out of a fine-grained token's reach for a collaborator; that needs a classic token (`repo`).
kubectl -n hephaisto create secret generic hephaisto-github --from-literal=GITHUB_TOKEN=github_pat_...

helm upgrade hephaisto oci://ghcr.io/truerelevance/charts/hephaisto -n hephaisto --reuse-values \
  --set github.enabled=true --set secrets.github=hephaisto-github \
  --set 'github.issues.repositories[0]=you/shop' \
  --set 'github.approvers[0]=1234567'        # gh api users/<login> --jq .id
```

`github.approvers` is who may answer a plan on the issue, by account **number** - a login can be
renamed and taken by somebody else. An approver replies with a comment whose first line is
`/approve`, or `/reject` and a reason; what is approved is the plan as Hephaisto stored it, never
the comment's text. Anybody else's `/approve` changes nothing and is answered once. With
`codeFix.mode` at `plan` or `off` an approval is refused and the issue is told which. Hephaisto
writes at most six comments for one issue it was handed: where the work stands (edited in place),
the plan, and a few one-time answers. With the list empty nobody can answer by comment and the
plan is approved in the console. **Whoever is listed can make Hephaisto push a branch** to the
listed repositories: list maintainers.

An issue whose pull request was merged or closed is not started over while it simply stays
assigned: unassign the account and assign it again (or close and reopen the issue) to hand it
back.

**Where else it shows.** The console lists what was taken under *work items*, and every attempt
has a page of its own (`/codefixes/<attempt id>`) with its history, the plan in full, and approve
and deny for the approver role. The MCP tools `list_code_fixes` and `get_code_fix` include an
issue's attempt, and `list_work_items` and `get_work_item` read the work items; no tool answers a
plan. And a work item's code fix is announced through `notifications.routes` like an incident's
(`CodeFixPlanReady`, `CodeFixPrOpened`, `CodeFixFailed`) - to a route that is **not scoped** by
namespace, cluster, kind or label and asks for no severity above `Info`, because an issue has
none of those; a fallback route is for incidents and does not take it. The Teams board stays a
board of incidents.

**What it takes on github.com**, as measured against it (`scripts/e2e/github-live.sh`), not as
read in its documentation:

- The agent's token above is enough: with Issues and Pull requests it can also ask whose token
  it is and what the repository's default branch is. It cannot push, and should not be able to.
- The coder's token (`secrets.codeFix`, key `GITHUB_TOKEN`): Contents read and write, Pull
  requests read and write. That clones, pushes the one branch, opens the **draft** pull request
  and assigns it. A plan without draft pull requests in private repositories refuses the
  `--draft`, and Hephaisto opens nothing else (GitHub's documentation; not measured).
- The account has to be **assignable** in the repository - a member or collaborator with write.
  GitHub answers an assignment it ignores with success.
- A **label** the context repository names for pull requests (`defaults.pr.labels` in its
  `repos.yaml`) has to exist in the target repository. `gh` refuses one that does not; the pull
  request is then opened without it, and the attempt's `deviations` say so.
- Text a model or a stranger wrote is posted with a zero-width space wherever GitHub would act
  on it - after `@`, `#`, `GH-`, inside `://`, after every `/` before a digit - so a copy of an
  address or a path out of a plan comment or a pull request's description carries that
  character.

**Egress.** With `codeFix.egressProxy` rendered, the agent's GitHub calls go through that proxy
(`github.useEgressProxy`, on by default): `api.github.com` is already on its allowlist, its log
then shows the agent's requests beside the coder's, and the chart adds the two NetworkPolicy
rules that needs - the agent may reach the proxy's pods on 3128, and the proxy admits the agent's
pods. Without the proxy and with `networkPolicy.egress.enabled`, GitHub has to be reachable
through `networkPolicy.egress.extraEgressCIDRs` on 443. With the agent's `mode: Off` nothing is
asked and nothing is taken.

## Try it without a cluster

The published image can run with no Kubernetes behind it at all, loaded with recorded
investigations from a real cluster:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TrueRelevance/hephaisto/main/demo/compose.yaml \
  | docker compose -f - up
```
