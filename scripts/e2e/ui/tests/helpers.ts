 * Navigate and wait until the Blazor circuit has started coming up.
 *
 * This is a Blazor **Web App** with `<Routes @rendermode="InteractiveServer" />`, so every
 * component renders TWICE: once as static server-rendered HTML delivered with the document, and
 * then again over the circuit, which replaces that DOM wholesale.
 *
 * Between those two moments the page looks completely finished and is completely inert. The
 * elements are there, they are visible, their text is correct - and a click or an input event
 * dispatched into them is dropped, because the handlers belong to a render that has not happened
 * yet. Measured against a live console: `h1` becomes visible at ~50ms and a click does not take
 * effect until ~600ms. Waiting on `h1` alone was never enough; see docs/backlog.md #48.
 *
 * WAIT ON THE NEGOTIATION, NOT ON A WEBSOCKET. The first version of this waited for a `_blazor`
 * websocket, which is a TRANSPORT rather than a state: SignalR negotiates, and where a websocket
 * cannot be established it falls back to server-sent events or long polling and the page is
 * perfectly interactive with no websocket ever opening. That version passed against a
 * development image and timed out against all nine specs on the published one - asserting how
 * the circuit connected rather than that it had.
 *
 * `/_blazor/negotiate` happens under every transport, so it is the portable signal. It is also
 * only the START of the handshake, which is why anything that INTERACTS must additionally be
 * written to retry - see `settle` below.

 * dropped silently - no error, no console entry - so the only reliable signal that the circuit
 * is live is that an interaction had an effect.
