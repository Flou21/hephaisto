/*
 * Renders the demo site.
 *
 * Input:  src/Hephaisto.Agent/Demo/transcripts/*.json - the same files the compose demo seeds a
 *         database from, read in place rather than copied, so there is one corpus and not two.
 * Output: dist/, static HTML with no client JavaScript at all.
 *
 * Why static rather than the real console: the console is Blazor Server, so every page is a
 * SignalR circuit against a process holding a database connection. Hosting that publicly would
 * mean running an agent on the internet to show what an agent looks like. The transcripts already
 * contain everything a detail page renders - the step trace, the digests the model actually saw,
 * the untruncated evidence blobs, the citations, the plan and the grade - so the page can simply
 * be rendered once, at build time.
 *
 * It reuses the console's own app.css and its hp-* class vocabulary, so this is the product's
 * appearance rather than an imitation of it.
 *
 * TWO DELIBERATE DIFFERENCES FROM DemoSeeder, both of which would otherwise be lies:
 *
 * 1. Timestamps are NOT rebased. DemoSeeder shifts the whole graph forward because
 *    RetentionService would otherwise sweep evidence older than its window. There is no retention
 *    service here and nothing to protect the rows from, so the original recording times are shown
 *    and the provenance sentence says so instead of claiming a shift that did not happen.
 * 2. The provenance sentence is otherwise ported verbatim from DemoSeeder.Provenance, including
 *    the structurally-unsound caveat. It states the grade whatever the grade was.
