# MinVer derives the version from git, and .dockerignore correctly excludes .git/ - so it
# cannot run in here, and left to itself it would stamp every image 0.0.0-alpha.0. The
# version is therefore computed ONCE outside and passed in:
#
#     V=$(dotnet minver -t v -p main.0)
#     docker build --build-arg VERSION=$V --build-arg COMMIT=$(git rev-parse HEAD) .
#
# `-p main.0` is not optional: minver-cli defaults to alpha.0 while this repo's MSBuild
# properties say main.0, so without it the CLI and the compiler disagree about what the same
# commit is called.

# NO --no-restore HERE, AND IT MUST NOT COME BACK.
#
# The restore above runs when only the .csproj files exist - that is the whole point of the
# layer split - and at that moment this project contains no Razor components. The Blazor
# framework's static web assets are resolved from that restore, so they are simply absent, and
# `--no-restore` at publish reuses the incomplete result. The manifest ships without
# `_framework/blazor.web.js`, `@Assets[...]` falls through to the literal path, and the browser
# gets a 404.
#
# Nothing about that fails the build or logs anything. The console renders perfectly, because
# the static server-side render is unaffected - and then nothing on it works. Every button, the
# approval controls included, is dead in every released image. Measured:
#
#     --no-restore   42489 byte manifest, 0 entries matching blazor   -> 404
#     (restored)     56532 byte manifest, blazor.web.js present       -> 200
#
# The layer split still earns its keep: the packages are already in the image's NuGet cache, so
# the restore this publish performs is near-instant and downloads nothing.
