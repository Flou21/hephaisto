 * This is a FILE rather than a `node -e` string on purpose. The previous version was a
 * heredoc containing a docker invocation containing `bash -lc` containing `node -e` with a
 * quoted JS program inside it, and two of the three bugs found while writing it were quoting
 * accidents rather than anything to do with the browser.
