 * The six combinations of what the reader chose and what their operating system says.
 *
 * These are assertions about computed values rather than screenshots, and that is deliberate:
 * the question here is whether the CASCADE resolves correctly, and a screenshot answers it only
 * incidentally while costing a baseline per case. A theme system that is right in four of six
 * is the ordinary bug - the two that break are almost always "chose light on a dark OS", where
 * the media query never matches, and "chose dark on a light OS", where it matches and wins.
 *
 * Both projects run this file, so each case is checked under both `prefers-color-scheme`
 * values and the project name is the OS half of the pair.
