/// <b>A personal chat, not the channel.</b> The channel holds one message, the board, which is
/// only ever edited - and an edit rings no phone. Something that needs a person therefore has to
/// be a new message somewhere, and a person's own chat with the bot is the one place where a new
/// message per alert is a history rather than a flood.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The card shows the incident as it is now, not as the event found it.</b> This is the one
/// channel that departs from the frozen snapshot, because its cards go on being edited: the
/// reconciler compares every live alert with its incident, and a card rendered from a snapshot
/// would differ on the first comparison and be edited for no visible reason. What the event
/// contributes is the line a lock screen shows, and the decision to post at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A second alert for an incident is a new message, and the older one is shrunk to a line that
/// points at it. Never deleted; see <see cref="ITeamsBotClient"/>.

/// <para>
/// <b>It takes a scope factory, not a database context.</b> A channel is held for the life of the

/// context directly would either fail the container's scope validation - which is how this was
/// found, on the dev cluster, by an agent that would not start - or, with validation off, keep
/// one context alive for ever. Each send opens its own.
